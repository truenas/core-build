[Services]

# This is a list of comma-seperated services provided by this package.
# "reboot" is kinda special.
# Note that I removed "DirectoryServices"
# services = SMB, AFP, NFS, iSCSI, WebDAV, reboot
# The above code will be uncommented because we are not ready for
# rebootless updates in freenas10 yet, so instead just `reboot`
services = reboot


# This is a list of comma-seperated services that will always be
# be restarted when this package is update.  "all" means all services
# provided by this package.
# In this case, nothing is automatically restarted, because base-os requires
# a reboot unless otherwise stated.
# restart = all
