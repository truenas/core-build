Base Operating System and Software
The base operating system version for TrueNAS 11.0-U2 is FreeBSD 11-STABLE,
bringing in a number of bug fixes, performance improvements, and new
 drivers. FreeBSD ports have been updated to follow the FreeBSD 2016Q4
 branch.

Hardware Support
Support for the TrueNAS X10 has been added. Information for racking and
connecting to a TrueNAS X10 is available in the TrueNAS User Guide. Note
that that the X10 hardware requires TrueNAS version 11.0-U2 or higher.

Alert Services
A new System -> Alert Services screen makes it possible to send important
alerts through external services, including AWS-SNS, Hipchat, InfluxDB,
Slack, Mattermost, OpsGenie, PagerDuty, and VictorOps.

ALUA
This version introduces ALUA (Asymmetric Logical Unit Access) support,
allowing an ALUA-enabled iSCSI initiator to discover and use the best
storage path to a TrueNAS node. With ALUA, clients automatically ask for
and use the best path to the storage. If a TrueNAS HA node becomes
inaccessible, the initiator automatically switches to the next best
alternate path to the storage. ALUA can be enabled on the TrueNAS system
by checking the "Enable iSCSI ALUA" box in Sharing -> Block (iSCSI) ->
 Target Global Configuration. 

Directory Services
An Active Directory Enable Monitoring option has been added and is disabled
 by default. When enabled, this restarts the Active Directory service after
 a temporary loss of communications with an Active Directory server.
 Previously, a loss of communications with the AD server would stop the
 Active Directory service, requiring a manual restart.

Filesharing
Samba, used for SMB file sharing, has been updated to 4.6.4 and patched
to address CVE-2017-11103.

Support for NT4 domain controllers been removed from Directory Services.

Services
An enhanced Services screen adds a checkbox to directly set which services
 start at boot.

The S3 service has been added, providing the ability to build hybrid and
private S3-compatible object storage services, allowing fast access to
locally hosted object stores.


TrueNAS vCenter Plugin
The vCenter plugin has been updated to version 2.1.0 which adds support
for advanced provisioning, datastore snapshot management, LUN management,
ZFS pool management, ZFS pool health status, and Role-Based Access Control
(RBAC).

VAAI for NAS
The client plugin for using VAAI for NAS is pending certification. Call
us at 1-855-GREP4IX (US Toll Free) or 1-408-943-4100 if you need a copy
of the required plugin or instructions on how to install and use it.
