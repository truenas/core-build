Additionally, these bug fixes and features are specific to TrueNAS:

There have been several bug fixes and new alerts for HA. The active node
will now wait for the passive node to stabilize before turning the HA
icon green. The system will indicate that you cannot destroy or detach a
volume when failover is enabled and warn before deleting a pool that is
required for HA to function. Additionally, the system will warn when
locking the last volume as this will prevent failover from functioning
correctly. An alert will also be generated when the passive node is
unreachable via the failover interface and the system will not allow a
failed passive node to take the active node's IP address. A warning will
be issued when removing the last HA critical interface. Finally, the
system will alert when the boot volume of the passive node is not healthy.

Several alerts have been added to provide advance notification with
regards to licensing. These include email notifications at 14, 30, 90,
and 180 days before support contract expiration and at support contract
expiration. Additionally, an alert will be generated when the number of
connected JBODs exceeds the license.

The  System Serial, System Product, and License fields have been added to
System -> Information. For HA configurations, the System Serial will also
include the serial number of the other HA node.

The View Enclosure screen has moved from Storage -> Volumes to System.

The “Factory Restore” button has been renamed to “Reset Configuration
Defaults”.

The PDF version of the Guide has been moved from Support to the Guide icon
which now provides a drop-down to select either the HTML or the PDF
version of the Guide.
