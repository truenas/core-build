TrueNAS 11.1-U5 introduces Self-Encrypting Drive (SED) support. Refer to
https://www.ixsystems.com/blog/library/using-self-encrypting-drives/ for
an overview of the SED implementation and how to manage these devices on
a TrueNAS system.

This version includes the Changelogs listed at:

Additionally, TrueNAS 11.1-U5 provides further improvements to HA. For
HA configurations using encrypted pools, the pools are properly detached
when demoting an active node to passive or when a successful failover
occurs. Should both nodes power cycle, the UI will prompt for the
passphrase, allowing the pools to become available.

For systems using the Netdata service, this service is automatically
restarted after a failover event. For all HA configurations, logging events
for both the active and passive controllers are logged to stable storage.

The End-User Agreement (EULA) has been updated. During initial setup, the
login screen will display the EULA and options to agree to the terms or
to cancel the EULA display. Cancelling the display will still provide
access to the GUI but the EULA will display on subsequent logins until the
user agrees to the terms. The EULA is available online at
https://support.ixsystems.com/truenasguide/tn_eula.html.
